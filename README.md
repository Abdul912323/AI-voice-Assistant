AI voice Assistant using python


The Python Assistant's source code is written in the Python programming language and is made up of numerous functions that carry out different duties. The required libraries for speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion are imported in the first two lines of code. The speech recognition engine and text-to-speech engine are both initialized in the following lines 

While the 'listen' function is used to detect voice and return the spoken text, the'speak' function is defined to convert text to speech . The 'get_name' method returns the name of the Python Assistant, which is named Morty [6], whereas the 'get_time' function returns the current time. By giving the note's content and storing it as a text file, the user can create a new note using the 'create_note' function

The following libraries will be used to build a voice assistant:
路       Pyttsx3: This library is used to convert text into speech
路       SpeechRecognition: With the help of this library, we can identify speech from audio sources, like a microphone
路       OS: To interface with the operating system, such as generating and opening files, use this library
路       Datetime: To obtain the current date and time, use this library
